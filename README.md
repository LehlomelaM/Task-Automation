# Task Automation

This project is a work in progress (WIP) aimed at developing custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks in my daily workflow. Currently, the focus is on identifying areas for automation to enhance my productivity.  The scripts will be continuously refined and expanded based on evolving needs and process improvements.

## daily_run.sh
Daily Git Version Control Backup (Cron Task)

## git_auto_commit.py and auto_commit.sh
Automated Git Push Scripts

## move_files_to_folders.py
Improved Note Organization with Tag-Based Sorting (Python Script): This Python script streamlines note organization within Notable by automatically sorting files into designated folders based on assigned tags (e.g., "Learning" tag moves files to the "Learning" folder).
